<h1>COVID19-Marketplace</h1>

<h4>What insipired us to do this?</h4>
What made us build this application is that, we often hear news about lockdown announcements and what people do first when they hear this is bombing the stores (panic buying) to have more essential items in hand. As a result, the spot becomes over crowded where there is a risk of virus spreading.

<h4>What it does?</h4>
Our application is built to make users pre-book their slot for market they wish to go. Before that, the administrators / the shop owners could add the availability of their shops, maximum number of people per time slot and few related stuffs. On booking, the user would receive an QR code in the application which they have to show when they are visiting the shop on entry and exit. By this scanning, we get real time updates on how much people inside the shop currently, and many more insights in a form of dashboard.
